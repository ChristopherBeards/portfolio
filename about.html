        <h3 class="text-secondary">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The art of simplicity has always had a place in my heart. Whether it's through meditation, the practice of yoga,
          art, or teaching. The ability to bring the seemingly complex down to a practical level in order to integrate and
          use it as as a means of expression is how my life is lived. Through programming, I'm able to practice this everyday.
          Welcome to my journey...</p>
